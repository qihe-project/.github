## Community Guidelines

Our GitHub organization grants relatively open permissions to all members, as more fine-grained access controls require paid features.
We rely on the integrity and good faith of our community members to use their access thoughtfully, responsibly, and with respect for the community.

**Please avoid any actions that could harm the repositories or the organization:**
- ❌ Creating unauthorized repositories, projects, or teams within this organization
